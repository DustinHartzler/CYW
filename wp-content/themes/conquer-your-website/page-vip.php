                <p>You can create an awesome website that will drive customers to your business AND be encourage them to buy from you.<br />
<br />
My mission is to help you quickly &amp; easily turn your current WordPress website into a finely tuned machine, without spending hours scouring the web for instructions.  </p>

Your audience is buying your products (books, courses, affiliates, you name it) like crazy and getting big results from your expertise. You wake up, roll over, check your phone and you’ve made a sale while you slept (best feeling ever!)</p>
<p>But you may be thinking, how can I gain the knowledge to use my WordPress site to my benefit and stop looking EVERYWHERE for all of the answers.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you exactly what to do step-by-step AND keep you organized. Eliminate confusion, ambiguity. Completely concrete. Pretty cool, right?</p>
<p>You might be thinking: “Will this work for me?”</p>
<p>Here’s what I can tell you:</p>
<p>Can I guarantee your massively epic results? (That would be a sketchy move on my part.) Obviously I can’t guarantee exactly how well your website will perform, BUT&#8230; I can give you the EXACT (and I mean exact) blueprint of how I set up every website I create.</p>
<p>Conquer Your Website is different. Lots of folks out there say “Go create a WordPress site,” but they don’t tell you EXACTLY what to do step-by-step.</p>
<h2>I’ve gone through all the “figuring it out” so you don’t have to.</h2>
<h2><span style="color: #FFF;">And that is exactly what you will be getting with Conquer Your Website. </span></h2>
<h2>The exact proven step-by-step system. No confusion. No ambiguity. Complete hand holding. Showing you EXACTLY what to do and walking you through the entire process.</h2>
<p>It isn’t designed for folks that have never used WordPress or don’t want to put in the work. Simple as that.</p>

<p>As soon as you purchase, you will get immediate access (via user name and password) to Conquer Your Website.</p>
<p>-Lifetime access and login 24/7 (it is all digital + downloadable so you can login to access the content &amp; download the course and take it on the go with you as well)</p>
<p>-Content is available in video + slides (.MOV), audio download (.MP3) and slides (.PDF)</p>

                <h2 class="bigtitle">So Now you‘re thinking,<br />
How do I get started?</h2>
                <p>How much will I need to invest in Conquer Your Website? You could try to figure it out on your own and spend thousands upon thousands or “hire a consultant” for $1,000+. I charge $150 an hour to help folks through the process for one-on-one consulting</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">For Conquer Your Website step-by-step system you will be paying: $297</h4>
<p>And because you get instant access, you can get started today (no waiting for anything in the mail&#8230;as I said before, everything is online ready for you to consume/download at your own pace).</p>
<p>Here is one way to think about it:</p>
<p>Imagine spending hours hunting down the perfect settings for backing up your website or your could watch one short video and have everything figured out.</p>
<p>Or if you build websites for clients, it's easily worth the cost of $300 to charge your client to set everything up (and you can pass along the cost to them).</p>
<p>And&#8230;to make it even easier for you we are doing some never-done-before payment plans (because we are cool like that) that will be offered for a very limited time. Again, love rewarding action takers.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Three options:</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">#1: $297 one time payment</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">#2: $79 x 4 monthly payments (coming soon!)</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">#3: $29 x 12 monthly payments (coming soon!)</h4>
<p>So you can get started today for as little as $29.</p>
